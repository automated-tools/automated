Sometimes it’s difficult to determine a project direction. To help tackle that, the following are some project intentions:

- Lean on the actual code where possible to minimize workload and prevent misconfiguration
- Store artifacts in the repo, so the repo itself is the source of truth
- Organize and facilitate, but offload as much work as possible. I.e., be a pass-thru, not a destination
